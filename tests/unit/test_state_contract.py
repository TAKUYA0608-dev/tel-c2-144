"""TEL-C2-144 — the state contract is machine-checked, not asserted field by field.

Checking credentials and Pydantic shapes only lets a nested annotation be added without any test
noticing — which is how ``enriched_context: NotRequired[dict]`` came to contradict a sibling
template's own documented rule.

Two halves, both needed. Checking only declared fields would let the rule be escaped by deleting a
declaration; checking only the effective state would flag the platform's own field forever.

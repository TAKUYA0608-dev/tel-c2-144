"""S-4 coverage is machine-checked: every execute() path leaves a domain trace event.

A node that returns ``{}`` on the upstream-degraded path without emitting leaves a degraded run with
steps that have no audit record at all — while the envelope still reports ``audit_logged: True``.
Scanning by hand finds one; scanning by machine finds all of them, including the publication path
that upstream rejections actually land on.

The static half stops the gap from reappearing anywhere; the behavioural half proves the static
check is describing the real runtime. Neither is written against a hand-maintained list of event
names — the expectation is derived from the source, so adding a node cannot quietly fall outside it.

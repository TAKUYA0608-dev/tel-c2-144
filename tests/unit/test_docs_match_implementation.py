"""Identifiers named in the docs must exist in the implementation.

A sibling template's docs named a taxonomy key the implementation did not have — a substitution
artefact from porting from another template — and its `docs/07` still described the source domain,
listing an event and provenance namespaces that agent never emits or accepts.

Both are the same failure: prose drifting from the code with nothing checking. Reviewing the docs by
eye finds them once; this finds them every time. It deliberately checks *identifiers* — taxonomy
keys, trace events, provenance namespaces — because those are the parts an operator will copy
verbatim into a payload, a query or an alert, and a wrong one silently does not match.

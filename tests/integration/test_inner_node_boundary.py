"""The inner workflow must run through the framework node boundary, not around it.

Review 2026-08-05 (High): the inner graph was driven by a hand-rolled `run_linear()` helper
that called each `FunctionNode.execute()` directly. That skips `BaseNode.__call__` — the S-1 trust
gate, the S-2/S-3 hooks and the framework's own lifecycle/S-4 events — so the inner nodes' declared
`required_trust_level = VERIFIED_EXTERNAL` was not enforced on the path production actually takes.
The helper and the `GraphNode.execute()` override that called it are both gone; the framework's
`GraphNode.execute()` drives the subgraph.

The outer-path test could not have caught this: it asserts on the published envelope, which is
identical either way. This asserts on the traversal itself.

"""Marketplace Pod entrypoint — one-shot process, referenced by the Dockerfile CMD.

Template-owned (the scaffold ships a blueprint with placeholders): it targets
this template's own Graph and makes the construction-time LLM decision this
template's reviewed design depends on.

`config["llm"]` decides behaviour, so it is resolved before the agent is built:

  - keys present  -> `config["llm"] = SecretsAzureLLM(provider)`; a call that
    later fails is a withheld item (this template's reviewed per-item design);
  - keys absent   -> no `config["llm"]`, this template's deliberate
    deterministic-only fallback — identical to a keyless HTTP deployment.

One provider, one identity: the chain is built once here with the same
`namespace` `src/api/server.py` hands to `secrets_factory`, the LLM decision
is made from that provider, and it is bound so the runner reuses the same
instance rather than building its own.

Which wheel the image carries is a deploy-time choice, and they differ
(measured against both): `load_agent_config` and
`build_marketplace_secret_provider` exist only in agentcore 1.0.2, so each has
its same-behaviour path on the vendored 1.0.1 written out below;
`wait_for_egress` is awaited by 1.0.2's `marketplace_app` and by neither 1.0.1
wheel, so the wait is owned here. The bootstrap imports stay inside functions:
they ship in the wheel only with the `[marketplace]` extra.

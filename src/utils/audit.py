"""S-4 audit emission (best-effort, never raises).

The production framework exposes `emit_trace_event(event_type, payload, state)` from
`shared.utils.audit_logger` (SDK: the S-4 audit rule, how-to/use-shared-services). The local SDK stub does not
ship it, so this shim keeps every call site identical in both environments — the same idiom
`src/api/server.py` uses for its framework imports.

**It must never raise.** A node's `execute()` that dies inside an audit call turns into
`node_error` and fails the PB-6 invoke-order boundary, which is exactly how the wrong import
signature was caught in CI on a sibling template.

**No-persist (SoT §4 Step 7)**: callers pass counts, rule references and error codes only. Never a
raw incident description, a KPI extract, a work-log line, a subscriber identifier, a site address,
or a rejected value.
